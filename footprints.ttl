a footprint gives information, in a linked data world, as to where
information about a new thing will be put.

 A footprint gives information to allow the construction of the URI
for a new thing, and specifies whether link from the old thing (source)
to the new thing (destination) is forward or bidirectional.

Footprints may also give consistency information
about making separate links of new things also in specific places,
such as master lists and indexes, etc.""" .
