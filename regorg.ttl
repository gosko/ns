  rdfs:comment "rov:RegisteredOrganization is the key class for the Registered Organization vocabulary and represents an organization that is legally registered. In many countries there is a single registry although in others, such as Spain and Germany, multiple registries exist. A Registered Organization is able to trade, is legally liable for its actions, accounts, tax affairs etc. Legal entity status is conferred by the act of registration cf. org:FormalOrganization that applies to any legal entity, including those created by other legal means. This makes registered organizations distinct from the broader concept of organizations, groups or, in some jurisdictions, sole traders. Many organizations exist that are not legal entities yet to the outside world they have staff, hierarchies, locations etc. Other organizations exist that are an umbrella for several legal entities (universities are often good examples of this). This vocabulary is concerned solely with registered organizations. In RDF, Registered Organization is a sub class of the Organization Ontology's org:FormalOrganization which is itself a sub class of the more general 'Agent' class found in FOAF and Dublin Core that does encompass organizations, natural persons, groups etc. - i.e. an Agent is any entity that is able to carry out actions."@en;

Some jurisdictions recognize concepts such as a trading name or alternative forms of a legal entity's name. The alternative name property can be used to record such names but should not be used to record translations of the primary legal name. Where more than one legal name exists and where they have equal standing but are expressed in different languages, identify the language used in each of the multiple legal names."@en;

rov:registration a rdf:Property, owl:ObjectProperty;
  dcterms:identifier "rov:registration"@en;
  rdfs:comment "The legal status of a registered organization is conferred on it by an authority within a given jurisdiction. The registration is therefore a fundamental relationship between a the organization and the authority with which it is registered. The details of the registration are provided as properties of the Identifier class which is defined by ADMS. The vocabulary sets no restriction on the type of legal identifier. In many countries, the business register's identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain and elsewhere. Although there is no formal cardinality constraint on any property in the Registered Organization Vocabulary, it is questionable whether a description of a registered organization without this property and an associated Identifier class will be of any value."@en;
