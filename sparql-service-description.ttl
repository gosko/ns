### Classes

sd:Service a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "An instance of sd:Service represents a SPARQL service made available via the SPARQL Protocol." .

sd:Language a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "An instance of sd:Language represents a subset of the SPARQL language that may be provided by an sd:Service." .

sd:Function a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "An instance of sd:Function represents a function that may be called as part of a FILTER clause or aggregate or project expression." .

sd:ScalarFunction a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf sd:Function ;
	rdfs:label "An instance of sd:ScalarFunction represents an extension function that may be used in a SPARQL FILTER/HAVING clause or a project expression." .

sd:AggregateFunction a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf sd:Function ;
	rdfs:label "An instance of sd:AggregateFunction represents an extension function that may be used in a SPARQL aggregate query HAVING clause or project expression." .

sd:EntailmentRegime a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "An instance of sd:EntailmentRegime represents an entailment regime used in basic graph pattern matching (as described in SPARQL 12.6 @@ SPARQL 1.0 spec reference)." .

sd:EntailmentProfile a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "An instance of sd:EntailmentProfile represents a profile of an entailment regime. An entialment profile MAY imply restrictions on what constitutes valid RDF with respect to entailment." .

sd:Dataset a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "An instance of sd:Dataset represents a SPARQL Dataset comprised of a default graph and zero or more named graphs." .

### Instances

sd:SPARQLQuery a sd:Language ;
	rdfs:label "The SPARQL query language as described by the SPARQL Query Language 1.1 document." .

sd:SPARQLUpdate a sd:Language ;
	rdfs:label "The SPARQL update language as described by the SPARQL 1.1 Update document." .

sd:DereferencesURIs
	rdfs:label "When used as the object of the sd:feature property, indicates that a SPARQL service will dereference URIs used in a FROM or FROM NAMED clause and use the resulting RDF in the dataset during query evaluation." .

sd:UnionDefaultGraph
	rdfs:label "When used as the object of the sd:feature property, indicates that the default graph of the dataset used during query evaluation is comprised of the union of all the named graphs in the dataset." .

### Properties

sd:url a rdf:Property , owl:InverseFunctionalProperty ;
	rdfs:domain sd:Service ;
	rdfs:label "The service URL of an sd:Service supporting the SparqlQuery interface." .

sd:feature a rdf:Property ;
	rdfs:domain sd:Service ;
	rdfs:label "Releates an instance of sd:Service with a resource representing a supported feature." .

sd:defaultEntailmentRegime a rdf:Property ;

	rdfs:domain sd:Service ;
	rdfs:range sd:EntailmentRegime ;
	rdfs:label "Releates an instance of sd:Service with a resource representing an entailment regime used for basic graph pattern matching. This property is intended for use when a single entailment regime by default applies to all graphs in the dataset. In situations where a different entailment regime applies to a specific graph in the dataset, the sd:entailmentRegime should be used to indicate this fact in the description of that graph." .

sd:supportedEntailmentProfile a rdf:Property ;

	rdfs:label "Releates an instance of sd:Service to a function that is supported as either a scalar, value testing function (as described in SPARQL 11.6 @@ SPARQL 1.0 spec reference) or an aggregate function. The rdf:type of the function may be used to indicate which of these function types apply, being either sd:ScalarFunction or sd:AggregateFunction." .

sd:defaultDatasetDescription a rdf:Property ;
	rdfs:domain sd:Service ;
	rdfs:range sd:Dataset ;
	rdfs:label "Releates an instance of sd:Service to a description of the default dataset available when no explicit dataset is specified." .
