	rdfs:label "The sd:Language representing the SPARQL 1.1 Update language." .

sd:DereferencesURIs
	rdfs:label "When used as the object of the sd:feature property, indicates that a SPARQL service will dereference URIs used in a FROM or FROM NAMED clause and use the resulting RDF in the dataset during query evaluation." .

sd:UnionDefaultGraph
	rdfs:label "When used as the object of the sd:feature property, indicates that the default graph of the dataset used during query evaluation is comprised of the union of all the named graphs in the dataset." .

sd:RequiresDataset
	rdfs:label "When used as the object of the sd:feature property, indicates that the query processor requires an explicit dataset declaration (based on either FROM/FROM NAMED clauses in the query or the appropriate SPARQL Protocol parameters)." .

sd:EmptyGraphs
	rdfs:label "When used as the object of the sd:feature property, indicates that the underlying graph store supports empty graphs. Such support impacts operations that might otherwise trigger the removal of a graph from the graph store." .
