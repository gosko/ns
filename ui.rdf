        <comment>Must be a valid CSS style string such as one could put in
        an HTML style attribute.  Depedning on teh user interface system, this can
        by given to individuals, classes or properties. It is up to a user interface 
        which wants to draw on them to pick how it uses styles from which parts
        of the data it has.  For example, the style of a class may be picked 
        to distinguish information about things in that class.</comment>
